# Bitcoin_time_series_forecast_project
Developed and tested 10 models including LSTM, Conv1D, RNN for Bitcoin price prediction (window = 7, horizon = 1). Na√Øve Bayes/baseline model of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 505.51 was improved which successfully improved by creating an Ensemble model with an MAE of 502.835 while making visualization of all results. I Transitioned from univariate to multivariate forecasting by  in Bitcoin halving. Built and tested N-BEATS algorithm, Turkey problem (possible event that can cause the data to swing way beyond usually like COVID-19) was considered.
