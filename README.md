# Bitcoin_time_series_forecast_project
This is a Bitcoin_time_series_forecast_project for predicting the future price of bitcoin. I experimented and built 10 models including LSTM, ensemble and RNN. Mostly models where of window_size 7 and horizon 1. I considered  turkey problem (possible event that can cause the data to swing way beyond usually like effect of COVID-19).
